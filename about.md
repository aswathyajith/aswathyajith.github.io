I am a Programmer working at the Computation Institute, University of Chicago
and Argonne National Lab. I work on a parallel scripting language called
[Swift](http://swift-lang.org/).

I care deeply about the code I write and the systems I help build.
Some of my projects are hosted on [github](https://github.com/yadudoc).

I paint, mostly with watercolors and pastels, and I love sharing snaps of those. Here are albums of some [of](https://plus.google.com/photos/116382466219919107733/albums/5721248800877698081) [my](https://plus.google.com/photos/116382466219919107733/albums/5687527151415771585) [older](https://plus.google.com/photos/116382466219919107733/albums/5557659605051670337) [work](https://plus.google.com/photos/116382466219919107733/albums/5567478538730462545)

[Star Trek](http://www.startrek.com/page/star-trek-the-next-generation) and [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/) have influenced me a great deal over that past year (2013) and you are bound to see references and parallel ideas in my writings.
