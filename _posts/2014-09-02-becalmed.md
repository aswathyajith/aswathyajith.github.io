You are at the sea, surrounded by the warmth of unhindered sunshine of a summer day.
There is the gentle roll of the waves, the occassional squaking of a hungry seagull.
There is calm, the comfort of the routine, and the certainity that you are not going anywhere.

There is no wind in the sails and no harbor to call home.

My idle brain is this ship, lost in the sea, aimless without a bearing.
