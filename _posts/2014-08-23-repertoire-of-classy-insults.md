Scraped from reddit for the most part:

"I can explain it to you, but I can't comprehend it for you"

"I love how you state the obvious, with such a sense of discovery"

"I'd like to agree with you, but then we would both be wrong"

"Do not speak unless you intend to improve the silence, please"

"You make me feel like a better person"

"When a savage speaks, silence will suffice"

"I refuse to have a batle of wits against an unarmed opponent"
