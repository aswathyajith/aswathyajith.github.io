I recently got interested in Leather craft, and managed to make a couple of small leather goods at the [Hack Arts Lab](http://arts.uchicago.edu/hack-arts-lab-hal)

My wallet that I'd bought from India was not only falling apart, it was also made of poor quality chome tanned leather.
Now with my newfound knowledge, I couldn't allow myself to continue carrying such a shoddy piece of work
I wondered if I could make myself a minimalist wallet with a focus on durability with a reasonable amount of effort.

When I find something interesting, I obsess about it. I spent an inordinate amount of time watching saddle stitching videos on youtube.
I learnt about different types of leather, tanning processes, thicknesses, crafting methods and found all of it fascinating.
I found Horween, one of the oldest tanneries in the US and it's awesome (but proprietary) [Chromexcel tanned leather](http://horween.com/101/chromexcel-2/).
Chromexcel has the reputation for being incredibly long lasting as well as developing a beautiful patina with use. I had to have this material.

Since Horween deals with large volumes it is nearly impossible to buy small quantities from them directly. I ended up following advice from this excellent post
on [how to buy Horween leather](http://www.makesupply.com/info/a-brief-guide-to-buying-horween-leather/) and got myself about 8 square feet of 5oz, brown Chromexcel.

I came across the minimalist designs by [Noah Lambert](http://noahlambert.com/), and I loved the design.

The making continued in Part 2.
