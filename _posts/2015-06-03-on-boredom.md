I've always felt that waiting in queue for the rollercoaster ride is the experience you pay for.
The anticipation builds up as you hear the screams draw closer and suddenly further away as the
ride snakes its way back to the end. The crescendo is when you are strapped in and the ride starts,
you experience first hand what you imagined it to be when you were waiting in queue.
5 minutes into a rollercoaster ride, the mechanical contraption has done everything it can do, and
I find myself thinking "Is that it ? Is it done ? When does this stop ? I need to get off this one
so that I can queue up for the next ride"

I'm a programmer, an okay programmer. In my work, which consumes most of my waking hours, I find
myself going over a routine. I get excited about an idea, an idea that I can implement and bring
to reality. The anticipation of engineering something and making it work is a great feeling. The
singular focus on programming a sequence of logical steps to bring what was just an idea to something
concrete is just as fun. All this is pales in comparison to the rush from seeing your little creation
work, and soon the joy fades, the challenge has ended and I revert to the basis state, a state of boredom.

All the pleasures of the world that I know of, follow this pattern. Every single one. And it irks
me to no end that there is no sustainable way to get out of it. I realized that I might hate the
world for being inadequate entertainment. I wondered why it has to be so, why must there be no way
out of this.

The realization that it was me, not the world was obvious in hindsight. And it was just not me,
it was everyone, it was the nature of every normal living being. We adapt to what we have, hedonic
adaptation is what the learned folks call it. The new high becomes the basis, or in looking at it
another way, the state of being bored is our base state, and it our nature to crave to get a high.
