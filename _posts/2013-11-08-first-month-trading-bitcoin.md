I used to mess with ad-hoc distributed systems in college and I remember
checking out bitcoin mining as a test application. That plan never materialised
and I had forgotten all bitcoin for a while. With the flurry of media coverage
over Silkroad shutdown , bitcoin was in the spotlight. Soon, I got an account
verified with [Coinbase] (https://coinbase.com) and what a wonderful month it has been.
Previous all time high has been broken, prices seem to be comparitively stabler, Bitcoin
China exchange opened the floodgates for chinese investors and there is a bitcoin ATM in
Canada.

I am not going to write about the risks and potential of Bitcoin, topics which have been
debated over in great length. Instead I would write about my first month as a newly minted
investor. This is the first time I've invested money and I would like to note my mistakes
and my learning from this endeavour.

Yes, I made the newbie mistake of watching the charts after my Bitcoins arrived in the wallet
for price drops and panic sold. "Sell high, buy low" is not as easy to follow through with
money and emotions involved. I've learned to discipline myself by writing down rules and conditions
at which I would either buy or sell.
