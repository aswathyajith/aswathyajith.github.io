This post is not a metaphor for what started as a paper plane, and finally became the roaring jet that rules the skies.
I wish it was, but it really isn't.

The long awaited package from the Kickstarter funded [PowerUp 3.0 - Smartphone Controlled Paper Airplane project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/393053146/powerup-30-smartphone-controlled-paper-airplane) is finally here. I had ordered two of the basic packages for $40 each, pretty reasonable I think.

The package comes with the attachment for the paper planes, which is a bluetooth module connected to a propeller and a rudder.
A 1200mAh portable battery/charger comes with it, that seems to hold enough charge for hours of fun at the park.
There's 2 printed and somewhat stiffer sheets of paper for 2 different plane models; the Invader and Nakamura.
I haven't tried the waterproof sheets which come with template for the Nakamura model, so far.
