Human beings are lacking in the apparatus to harvest the most abundant source of energy on the Planet. Most organisms including us, ultimately depend on plant life to do this. We happen to be able to consume both plant life as well other organisms for sustenance.

The issue is that we have a choice on where our food comes from and some are not quite as ethical as the others. We could sustain ourselves by consuming meat for other human beings but cannibalism is considered terrible in most cultures/societies even when cannibalism is common amongst several species in nature. In western cultures we typically don't eat animals we keep as pets, such as dogs and cats. I think that we have some difficulty with the concept of killing
creatures that we empathize with for the sake of food, while most of us feel no remorse when
having either chicken or meat from cows for dinner. In fact we hardly even think of the living
beings that were raised, fed, most likely mistreated and then slaughtered on an industrial scale to get a piece of meat on your dinner plate. The worst part is that even when I think about
it, I do not feel as horrible as I think I should, and this note is about this issue.

It is not clear to me why the idea of eating meat from chicken does not elicit the same mental response of horror as the idea of eating meat from another human being or even a cat. Looking back at our history of slavery, I see how easily we could once treat one another as commodities to be bought, sold, and used and think of it as normal. There are parallels to be drawn to what we did back then to ourselves and what we do now to the meek creatures that we've labelled as inferior forms of life. Only these animals do not have the words to complain or the mind to organize a rebellion against their masters.

My current stance is that I will only eat creatures that are not smart enough to be self aware. I feel bad about this because even though they may not be capable of higher intelligence, they definitely are aware of their surroundings, they horrible conditions they are subjected to, and they most certainly are capable of experiencing pain. I think that I'm more of a monster for having thought this and not completely giving up on meat products.

Another thought to consider is that all living things die without exception. What if these farmed animals are treated fairly, given a far better life than they could have in the wild with no natural predators, fairly unlimited food, and freedom to reproduce. What if the only bargain, is that in return they are subjected to premature termination. Would that be ethical? It is certainly not possible to have these creatures choose between no existence vs a cushy life and then being painlessly terminated.
