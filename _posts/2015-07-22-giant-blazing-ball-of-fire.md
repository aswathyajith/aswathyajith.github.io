It is human nature to quickly accept even the most terrifying things.
Can you remember a moment in the recent past where it scared you
that there is a giant blazing ball of fire in the sky ?

Even scarier is the fact that it is a huge fusion reactor, which could easily
fit a million of our tiny little planet in itself. It is the largest self sustainging fusion reactor in our immediate vicinity, and it is burning itself away.
What is even more surprising is that for the same volume, the rate of energy released at the core of the sun is about a quarter that of the human body. With the immense volume of a star, this process still indirectly drives the wind, weather and life on Earth.

What would be really cool, is if these giant balls of gases could be extinguished and used at some later time when we have the ability to do so. Some sort of practical way to reversibly poison the fusion reaction. There is the risk that some mad terrorist could hold the Sun hostage, or even the rise of a Super villain straight out of Gotham. Even with the risks the potential to stop, and later harvest the energy within Stars and potentially even delay the heat death of the Universe sounds like a great plan.
