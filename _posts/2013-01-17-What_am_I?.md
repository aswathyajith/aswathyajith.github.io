Identity. Am I this body, flesh and mind ? Am I the mass of all thoughts and words heard and spoken ?
What is the _me_ that evades my deepest introspection ? Worse still, why does it evade my understanding ?

Most of my life, I've been driven by a deep instinct to be better.
Every day is a gift, to be at it, to be better than what I was yesterday.
Its no longer the destination but the whole path and process of change that entertains me.
In a way it gives reason for existence, because tomorrow will be something better.

Somewhere along this path, you feel that you are caught in the stream, changing, evolving and adapting to the future.
Yet, in the few moments of clarity when you pause to make sense, you realize that you are morphing to someone who you are not.
YOU are changing. But, then you realize that you never knew who you were.
Your eyes set at a distant future, never tried to set its sight upon itself. Then you panic.

I have not recovered, not once.

And we start all over again.
