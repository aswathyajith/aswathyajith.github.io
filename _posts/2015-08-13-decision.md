Life's purpose to expand valid choices to choose from, and to actively engage in making decisions.

If decisions were not made of our own volition, we are no different from cattle.

Expanding valid and viable choices allow you to enjoy life. If there were no decisions ahead of us, we'd be just existing, not living. To really live life there must be hard decisions ahead of us, that force us to think of outcomes and make a decision about which choice we take, and to live out the consequences.
