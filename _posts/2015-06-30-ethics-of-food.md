[Not proofread]

Human beings are lacking in the apparatus to harvest the most abundant source of energy on the Planet.
As a result, most organisms including us, ultimately depend on plant life to do this.
We happen to be able to consume both plant life as well other organisms for sustenance.

Being omnivores, we have a several choice on the source of our sustenance, and some may not be quite as ethical as others.
For example we could sustain ourselves by consuming meat from other human beings, but cannibalism is considered
terrible in most cultures/societies even when cannibalism is common amongst several species in nature.
In western cultures we typically don't eat animals we keep as pets, such as dogs and cats.
I think that we have some difficulty with the concept of killing creatures that we empathize with for the sake of food,
while most of us feel no remorse when having either chicken or beef for dinner.
In fact we hardly ever think of the piece of meat on the dinner plate in term of living being(s) that were farmed and slaughtered on an industrial scale.

It is not clear to me why the idea of eating meat from chicken does not elicit the same mental response of horror as the idea of eating meat from another human being or even a cat.
Looking back at our history of slavery, I see how easily we could once treat one another as commodities to be bought, sold, and used and think of it as normal.
There are parallels to be drawn to what we did back then to ourselves and what we do now to the mute creatures that we've labelled as inferior forms of life.
Only these animals do not have the words to complain or the mind to organize a rebellion against their masters.

My current stance is that I will only eat creatures that are not smart enough to be self aware.
I feel bad about this because even though they may not be capable of higher intelligence,
they definitely are aware of their surroundings, the horrible conditions they are subjected to,
and they most certainly are capable of experiencing pain.
I sometimes think that I'm a terrible person for having thought about these matters, and yet not completely giving up meat products.


Now, we can all agree that treating animals poorly is bad. What about the act of killing them ?
The animal do have to die at some point, what if they are killed (painlessly or not) at the peak age?
Would the gift of existence alone justify having brought these being to life for the purpose of feeding us ?
The more I think on this topic even more complications arise simply from the fact that we are bringing new sentient life into the world.

What if these farmed animals are treated fairly, given a far better life than they could have in the wild with no natural predators,
fairly unlimited food, and freedom to reproduce. What if the only bargain, is that in return they are subjected to premature termination.
Would that be ethical? It is certainly not possible to have these creatures choose between no existence vs a cushy life and then being painlessly terminated. This is partly because, the choice to exist only becomes available only after the being has come into existence. Secondly we do not have any means to meaningfully communicate with these creatures and assert whether the ones that we have brought to life do prefer to exist rather than not.

I believe that if I were to ask any person if they would prefer a duration of existence interspersed with pleasure and pain in varying degrees over the absolute of not existing, most would choose to exist. This question is a bit absurd because, if anyone were to truly think that
non-existence is better, they could choose to terminate their existence, but this I think is very rare. Only when human beings are pushed to extremes of pain, over time, and with no hope of improving their situation do people opt to end their existence, while the vast majority hold
on dearly to their existence and try to prolong their existence. So asking these individuals if they would choose to bring to existence beings which are mostly limited in the range of experience but existing nonetheless is a rigged question. Another possibility is that since we exist, and cannot comprehend what it means to not-exist, we inherently fear it, and we cannot quite compare the two choices clearly.

These choices are very relevant when it comes to raising animals for the sole purpose of culling them later in their lifecycle for food. These creatures have limited thought processes which probably limit them from understanding the purpose for which they are being farmed. They could be treated humanely, and made to suffer little to no pain. At which point, I think the collective weight of bringing to existence countless new minds however limited far outweighs not doing so.

Increasing the collective mass of being which can experience things by itself is a purpose worthy of some medieval age religious zeal. For now besides siring a large number of offspring, the next best thing is to eat meat and indirectly support the animal farms.
