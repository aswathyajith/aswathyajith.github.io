Over the one week spent ordering and waiting for the leather to get shipped to my place,
I went ahead with creating designs and trying out the Laser cutter at the [HAL](http://arts.uchicago.edu/hack-arts-lab-hal).
If you are a UChicago employee or student you can walk in and reserve time with the machines.

For the design I started with examining my own wallet to identify the absolute minimum I would carry.

Here's what it boiled down to :

 1.  A few currency bills
 2.  6 cards (3 Creditcards, 1 Transit, 1 ID, 1 Access card)
 3.  House key

With 6 cards, of which 2 are frequently accessed, I think separate slots makes sense. With a separate compartment for currency,
a Bifold design would be the closest fit. The [uni-fold wallet](http://noahlambert.com/shop/uni-fold-wallet) designs by Noah Lambert was a perfect match.
I decided that a separate pouch for the key would make the wallet asymmetric and add excess thickness to the wallet, and that was dropped.

The dimensions are dictated by the contents the wallet would carry. The width of the wallet is the width of the dollar bill plus allowances.
The breadth should be twice the width of a standard CC (85.60mm) with allowance for the gap in the middle.
Initially I put in 2mm wide slanted slits with a separation of 2mm to guide the stitching, which ended being too close.
In the second iteration, I increased the separation to 4mm which I think is just perfect. You can get the illustrator file I used from [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/wallet-template-2.ai).

Here's some snaps along the way:

On the laser cutter/engraver. The bright light is from the laser burning through the leather; smells nasty!

The edges end up charred from the Laser cutter. After cleaning, unstitched.

A shot of the angular slits I got laser cut for saddle stitching. These holes were off-measurement, and I had to skip the odd ones for the stitch

Stitching done! Alternate holes are left unused, but the stitching came out beautifully!
