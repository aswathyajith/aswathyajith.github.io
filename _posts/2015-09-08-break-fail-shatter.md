There is no Joy without pain. No success without failure.

To truly experience success, one must first fail. Experience failure,
have life shattering experiences and rebuild from the pieces.

One would be miserable if one were to expect life to be an unbroken
string of successes. A superior approach is to approach failures as
a trusted teacher, and learn from them. Learn not to make the same
mistake. Learn to be better.

Even if you've learnt from your mistakes and made no mistake, you might
still lose, such is life. Be strong when lightning strikes and burns
down the tree you cared for. Take risks and strive to fail faster, and
never risk all your chips.

Remember that when things shatter and shatter they will, you've been
given the chance to put things together better than ever before.
