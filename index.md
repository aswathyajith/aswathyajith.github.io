Hi! I am a Programmer working at the Computation Institute, University of Chicago
and Argonne National Lab. I work on an implicitly parallel programming language most
commonly used for running computational workflows-[Swift: Parallel scripting language](http://swift-lang.org/).

I like to look for patterns in the sea of random thoughts that comprise me.
Up close thoughts are like fish caught barehanded, they squirm till they break free.
Writing them down is the closest to really bagging them. You start to see what thoughts were of no value, and
which ones are worth sharing.

This is the bag of freshly caught fish. If you haven't noticed already I suck at metaphors, and often beat them to death.
