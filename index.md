## Welcome!

I am [Yadu](./about.html). I spend most of my time on Code, Art, and the
rest I prefer to call as Life. This blog reflects the same, and I tag
posts as such.

## What happened to my [old blog](http://humanint.posterous.com/)?

[Posterous](http://www.posterous.com//) got acquired by twitter, followed
by them shutting down their services. I have been a wanderer since then,
searching for the simpest blogging platform. After a lot of searching, I
think [Jekyllbootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) with [github pages](http://pages.github.com/) comes closest to my expectation of simplicity.
