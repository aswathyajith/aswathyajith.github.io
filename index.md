I like to think about why I think the way I think. I find it fascinating that the
mind and thought arise from seemingly chaotic and unpredictable misfirings of neurons.<br/>
Many thoughts make little sense when examined closely, and the process of writing them
down helps filter those that of no value.

This would be a record of my thoughts on ideas I find interesting like sci-fi, thought-experiments
and my active projects.
